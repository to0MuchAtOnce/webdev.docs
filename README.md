# webdev.docs

A docs website to help me learn technologies you can view the [site] (https://confident-hodgkin-2fca80.netlify.app/) here

# What is it?

I like the look of documentation sites like MDN, they are plain and simple, but they do what they are supposed to. I wanted to creat my own for the technologies I learn, as a way to better understand and gain experience in how a webpage goes together.

# The Content

The content of the site will largely be taken from courses that I am studying. My aim is not to take steal peoples work and make it my own, but to learn these technologies while making a functional website. All course content used will be listed here.

# Course Content
